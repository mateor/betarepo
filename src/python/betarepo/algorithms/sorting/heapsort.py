# ComplexityTheta(n log n)
# A bit slower in practice than quicksort - but has a better
# worst-case runtime.

# It can be slower than quicksort in practice because the worst-case
# of quicksort in most impls is very rare. And in heapsort
# there are a lot of element swaps, even if the data is already
# ordred.

# Not stable!

# Put the data in a min/max heap. The root is then the min/max.

# When an element is removed from the heap, it self balances
# so the next element will "bubble up" to the root. The
# heap operations are all superlinear - putting the elements
# in the list is dstrictly linear and is dominated by the heap operations.


# Heap properties
# Use a min-heap with the heap property of: A[PARENT (i)] <= A[i]
# Height of tree with n nodes is floor(lg n)
# nodes to height bounds: 2^h <= n <= 2^(h+1)-1  -- i.e. the last level must be between empty and full - 1.

# heapify - add an element and bubble it up to its proper position in the heap. O(lg n) - the heigth of the tree
# build_heap - linear time
# heap sort - O(n lg n)
# extract-min = remove the root rebalance= - O(lg n)

# Heap is a full binary tree (no empty spaces in interior levels) - so it can be represented as an array,
# which is space efficient.
